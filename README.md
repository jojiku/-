Here the principal component analysis is implemented in Python. Work plan:

1) Perform cluster analysis:
a. select a file for cluster analysis.
b. describe the resulting clusters;
c. give explanations and conclusions.

2) Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA):
a. check the applicability of the method;
b. perform variable space compression;
c. analyze the load matrix;
d. draw conclusions

3) Perform cluster analysis on new variables:
a. perform cluster analysis on selected Principal Components;
b. compare the results of points 1 and 2 in terms of the number of clusters obtained and their
interpretation.

4) Work sum up.
